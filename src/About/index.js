    <h2>About</h2>
    <div>
      <span>I have been fascinated by computers as long as I can remember.</span><br /><br />
      <span>Unfortunately, once my family got a Dell Pentium 4, I was not one of these kids who jumped 
        right in the terminal and started coding stuff. Neither did I know about MySpace and its CSS customization.
        I used the computer to play CS 1.6, watching videos and sometimes do some calculation in an Excel sheet. I did not now at the time the capabilities
         the tool I had in front had.</span> <br />
        <span>  I remember once opening an IDE, I think it was Pascal IDE, preinstalled, trying to type on it, and being frustrated because ..nothing was happening.
        Figured it out what it was years later. </span><br /><br />
        <span>I took my first programming steps in highschool in Italy. We started with HTML, CSS and Visual Basic Script</span> <br />
        <span>I liked it, but I was very confused about all this, what is a variable, what is a function, why do we even need them.</span>
        <span> Who would have thought that I would do that for a living in the future ..:D. </span>
        <span>After highschool, I took on a bootcamp of 3 months in full stack development. I was promised by the management of the bootcamp that they would find me a job
          after completing it, but it never happened.
        </span> <br />
        <span>Luckily, shortly after, I found a job myself, in a small startup in Udine.</span>
        <span>I started working as a Javascript developer. With some amazing colleagues I had, I learned a lot during that time.
          I learned, AngularJS (that felt like magic at the time btw :), got better in Javascript, HTML, CSS. Learned EspressJS and MongoDB. Learned problem solving and
          bug hunting. I had an amazing time.
        </span><br /><br />
        <span>After more than 1 year and a half working, I decided to move to Germany.
